International Argent Workstation ebuilds. For the moment it's version 1.2 :)

To install it as an overlay in a Gentoo planet distro, use the command: 

layman -f -a argentws -o https://gitlab.com/argent/argent-ws/raw/master/overlay-4layman.xml

== Atention ==
In order to have this repo stable enough, we propose adding the 'argent' overlay also!
Although not necessary
